# 🌿 MindMate - Mental Health Agent System — Capstone Project by Team Dynamo

A creative, smart, and extensible system designed to offer personalized mental‑health assistance using modern AI techniques.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement  
Mental health support is often hard to access due to  
- Limited availability of professionals  
- High cost barriers  
- Social stigma  
- Lack of personalized care  

This project solves the above by building an **AI‑powered conversational agent** that provides supportive interactions and guides users through exercises, journaling, and emotional regulation techniques.

---

## 🚀 Solution Overview  
The system uses:  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand user inputs  
- **Emotion classification models** to detect tone and mood  
- **Knowledge‑based suggestions** for coping strategies  
- **Memory‑based context handling** to enable longer, meaningful conversations  

It is modular, scalable, and built to be deployable as:  
- A web app  
- A mobile app  
- An API backend
